## Summary

Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TZIP.

## Abstract

A short (200-500 word) but comprehensive description of the issue being
addressed and the proposed solution.

## Motivation

It should clearly explain why the existing implementation is inadequate to
address the problem that the TZIP solves.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new
feature.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the
design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also 
provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important 
objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility

All TZIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities or supersede other TZIPs
must include a section describing these incompatibilities, their severity, and
solutions.

## Security Considerations

This section of the document should explain any security relevant features
of the proposal, or any critical issues for implemenenters. 

## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are recommended as are proofs of correctness via 
formal methods if applicable.

## Implementations

Any code already written.

## Appendix

A list of references relevant to the proposal.

## Copyright

All TZIPs must be in the public domain, or a under a permissive license
substantially identical to placement in the public domain.
