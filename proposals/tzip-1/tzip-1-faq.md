## What is a TZIP?

A TZIP is a design document providing information to the Tezos community, describing a feature for Tezos, its processes, or environment, and supporting the formal protocol governance process.


## Why do we need TZIPs?

Let's start from the assumption that Tezos needs some sort of asset standards comparable to the role "ERC" plays on Ethereum, which is something a lot of people have asked for. If we accept this premise, then there are two options:

1. Informal standards with no standards process
2. Formal standards with a standards process

There are examples of both kinds of standards in the blockchain community, but in our opinion informal standards are much more common. In general, informal standards make decision-making processes opaque and result in poorer quality standards documents. High-quality standards don't just appear overnight; they are public goods that have to be carefully and thoughtfully *built*. We think that a formal standards process is the best way to do this.
