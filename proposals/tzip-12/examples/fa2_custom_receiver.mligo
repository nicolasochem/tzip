(**
Implementation of the permission transfer hook, with custom behavior.
It uses a combination of a receiver while list and `fa2_token_receiver` interface.
Transfer is permitted if a receiver address is in the receiver white list OR implements
`fa2_token_receiver` interface. If a receiver address implements `fa2_token_receiver`
interface, its `tokens_received` entry point must be called.
