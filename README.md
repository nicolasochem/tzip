# Tezos Improvement Proposals (TZIPs)

TZIP (pronounce "tee-zip") stands for Tezos Improvement Proposal, which are documents that explain how the Tezos blockchain works or how it ought to work.



## What is a TZIP?

A TZIP is a design document providing information to the Tezos community, describing a feature for Tezos or its processes or environment, and supporting the formal protocol governance process. A TZIP should contain a concise technical specification and rationale which unambiguously articulates what the proposal is, how it may be implemented, and why the proposal is an improvement.

A TZIP should additionally contain an FAQ, which which documents, compares and answers alternative options, opinions and objections.
