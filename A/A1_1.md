## Summary

This standard extends `TZIP-A1` by defining a right-hand balance tree structure
for `or` and `pair` types. This is particularly useful for smart contract
`parameter` and `storage` types, since this structure minimizes the average
number of operations required to access elements of the tree.

## Abstract

TODO

## Definition of a Right-hand balanced Tree

A right-balanced tree can be defined recursively as follows:

- The left subtree has height equal to, or one less than the right subtree
- The right and left subtrees are balanced
- For clarity, all terminal leaves of the tree are considered balanced

For example, the following is a right-balanced

```
(or (or a b) (or c (or d e)))

       or
     /    \
    or     or
   / \    / \
  a   b  c   or
            / \
           d   e
```

If we insert a new node `f` into the above tree:

```
(or (or a b) (or (c d) (or e f)))

       or
     /    \
    or     or
   / \    /  \
  a   b  or   or
        / \  / \
       c  d  e  f
```

## Entry points

Contract `parameter` entry points are constrained to be the leaves of a right
balanced `or` tree. `or` constructors with **type**-annotations are considered
arguments rather than tree nodes and have a height of 1 for the purposes of the
tree definition.

## ADT Syntax sugar

The *ADT syntax sugar* is modified such that:

```
(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)    ~> mkRightBalancedTree pair '[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]
(a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n) ~> mkRightBalancedTree or   '[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]
```

where `mkRightBalancedTree` is a type-level fuction from a binary type constructor
and heterogenous list of types to a right balanced tree as defined above.

# CASE macro

The `CASE` macro is also modified such that it selects the correct branch of the
an entry-point `or` tree.
