## Summary

This standard extends `TZIP-A1` by defining a right-hand balance tree structure
for `or` and `pair` types. Structure of comb defined in
[TZIP-A1](/Proposals/TZIP-0004/A1.md#entrypoints) is the most obvious one, but the worst-case
performance of operations on it scales linearly with number of elements
in the comb which is suboptimal. Whereas tree structure allows reaching better
average performance of access and update operations.

Primary purpose of this standart is to guide implementation of high-level
languages over Michelson, albeit any contract can benefit, in terms of gas
costs, from using it.

## Definition of a Right-hand balanced Tree

A right-balanced tree can be defined recursively as follows:

- The left subtree has height equal to, or one less than the right subtree
- The right and left subtrees are balanced
- For clarity, all terminal leaves of the tree are considered balanced

For example, the following is a right-balanced

```
(or (or a b) (or c (or d e)))

       or
     /    \
    or     or
   / \    / \
  a   b  c   or
            / \
           d   e
```

If we insert a new node `f` into the above tree:

```
(or (or a b) (or (c d) (or e f)))

       or
     /    \
    or     or
   / \    /  \
  a   b  or   or
        / \  / \
       c  d  e  f
```

## ADT Syntax sugar

The [`Pair`s and `Or`s syntax sugar](/Proposals/TZIP-0004/A1.md#pairs-and-ors-syntax-sugar) is
extended to work for tuples and unions of arbitrary size:

```
(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)    ~> mkRightBalancedTree pair '[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]
(a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n) ~> mkRightBalancedTree or   '[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]
```

where `mkRightBalancedTree` is a type-level fuction from a binary type constructor
and heterogenous list of types to a right balanced tree as defined above.

# CASE macro

The `CASE` macro is also modified such that it selects the correct branch of
a balanced entrypoint `or` tree.
